### It's a good practice to keep your commands at the top of the config file. In this project, you'll need at least 2 commands:

# commands:
#   destroy-environment:
#     description: Destroy backend and frontend cloudformation stacks given a workflow ID.
#     ...

#   revert-migration:
#     description: Revert the last migration if successfully run in the current workflow.
#     ...

jobs:
  hello-world: # Delete this job when you get started
    docker:
      - image: amazon/aws-cli
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Say Hello
          command: |
            echo "Hello World"
