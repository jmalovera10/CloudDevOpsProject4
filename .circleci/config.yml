### It's a good practice to keep your commands at the top of the config file. In this project, you'll need at least 2 commands:

# commands:
#   destroy-environment:
#     description: Destroy backend and frontend cloudformation stacks given a workflow ID.
#     ...

#   revert-migration:
#     description: Revert the last migration if successfully run in the current workflow.
#     ...

jobs:
  build-frontend:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:12.16
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Lint frontend
          command: |
            cd frontend
            npm i
            npm run lint
      - run:
          name: Build frontend
          command: |
            cd frontend
            npm i
            npm run build
